# RC Plane Firmware

This repository contains the firmware code for an RC plane created by SlimeyDev and my friend. The code is written in C++ and is designed to run on an arduino for controlling the various functions of the plane such as motor speed, servos, and sensors.

## About

The RC Plane Firmware is a codebase designed for a custom-made RC plane by SlimeyDev and my friend. The codebase provides full control over the various components of the plane, such as servos, sensors, and motor speed, allowing the user to operate the plane with ease.

## Video

We have created a YouTube video detailing the process of how we made the RC plane and the development of the firmware code. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/).
